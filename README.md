# ZoomCollectionView for iOS
UICollectionView is great, but it is not zoomable (which is rather strange since
it is inherits from UIScrollView). This project is an attempt to implement zooming
using custom a UICollectionViewLayout which resizes itself to simulate the effect
we know and love from UIScrollView.
